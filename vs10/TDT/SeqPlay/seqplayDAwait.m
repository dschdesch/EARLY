function Mess = SeqplayDAwait(TimeOut);
% SeqplayDAwait - wait for seqplay DA conversion to finish
%   SeqplayDAwait waits until the squenced-play DA conversion, previously
%   triggered by seqplayGo has finished. It immediately returns when no DA
%   conversion was triggered.
%
%   SeqplayDAwait(T) uses a timeout of T ms, after which it returns even
%   when DA conversion has not finished. The default T is 10000 ms, that is,
%   10 seconds.
%
%   Mess = SeqplayDAwait(..) returns a message, which is empty on a regular
%   return, but returns an appropriate text message when timeout has been
%   reached, or when no seqplay DA conversion was triggered in the first
%   place.
%
%   See also Seqplay, SeqplayGo.

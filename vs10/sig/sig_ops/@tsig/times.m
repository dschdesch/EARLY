% tsig/times - multiply tsig objects
%   S*T or S.*T is the channel-wise product of tsig objects S and T. 
%   The channel counts of S and T must be compatible:  
%      [S.nchan T.nchan] == [M M] or [1 M] or [M 1], with M>=1.
%   The onsets of S and T are accounted for! The multiplication runs from 
%   min(S.onset,T.onset) to max(S.offset,T.offset) and S and T are aligned 
%   before being multiplied. In the non-overlapping part of S and T, the 
%   product S*T is zero. This amounts to assuming that S and T are zero 
%   outside their respective domains. For multiplication using a different 
%   convention concerning the non-overlap region, see tsig/modulate.
%
%   For tsig objects, there is no distinction between S.*T and S*T.
%
%   S*X or X*S, where S is a tsig object and X a scalar number, multiplies 
%   the samples of S by X. If X is a row vector, its elements multiply 
%   the corresponding channels of S. Note that multiplying a single-channel 
%   tsig by a row vector has the side effect of creating a multi-channel
%   tsig.
%
%   See tsig/plus for the caveats involved when using multi-term 
%   expressions (without parenthesis) consisting of both tsig objects and 
%   numbers.

function P = rdivide(S,T);
% tsig/rdivide - divide tsig objects
%   S/T or S./T is the channel-wise quotient of tsig objects S and T. 
%   The channel counts of S and T must be compatible:  
%      [S.nchan T.nchan] == [M M] or [1 M] or [M 1], with M>=1.
%   The onsets of S and T are accounted for! The division runs from 
%   min(S.onset,T.onset) to max(S.offset,T.offset) and S and T are aligned 
%   before being divided. In that part of the time domain which is outside S,
%   but inside T, S/T is set to 0 by definition. In the region outside T 
%   but inside S, S/T is set to S. This amounts to padding zeros and ones
%   in the out-of-time-domain values of S and T, respectively.
%
%   For tsig objects, there is no distinction between S./T and S/T.
%
%   S/X, where S is a tsig object and X a scalar number, divides the 
%   samples of S by X. If X is a row vector, its elements divide 
%   the corresponding channels of S. Note that dividing a single-channel 
%   tsig by a row vector has the side effect of creating a multi-channel
%   tsig.
%
%   X/S, where X is numerical and S a tsig object, equals X times the
%   reciprocal of S, 1/S. The same remarks on row vectors and channels
%   apply as for S/X above.
%
%   See tsig/plus for the caveats involved when using multi-term 
%   expressions (without parenthesis) consisting of both tsig objects and 
%   numbers.

%   See also tsig/plus, tsig/modulate, sig_ops/@tsig.

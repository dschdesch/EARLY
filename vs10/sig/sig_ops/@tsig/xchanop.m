function [Y, Mess] = xchanop(S, operator, defS);
% tsig/xchanop - across-channel function evaluation.
%   Helper function for tsig/median, etc. See those mfiles.
%   Syntax:
%    [P, Mess]  = xchanop(S, @Fun, defS)
%    or [P, Mess]  = xchanop(S, @fun, 'existingchannelsonly');
%
%    xchanop computes a sample-wise Fun([s1,s2,.]), where s1, s2 .. are the
%    simultaneous samples of channels S(1), S(2) .. .
%
%    The crucial thing is the time alignment. For those time instances
%    where some channels exist, and others don't, either a default
%    value DefS is substituted, or only those channels are passed to Fun which
%    exists at that time. The latter mode ('existingchannelsonly' option)
%    is done in blockmode using tsig/exist, so it is fast.
%
%    Note: use an anonymous function when you need to pass additional args
%    to Fun: myfun = @(x)fun(x,par1,..), and pass myfun to xchanop.
%
%   See also tsig/binop, tsig/relop.

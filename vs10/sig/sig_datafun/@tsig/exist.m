function E = exist(T, interval);
% tsig/exist - time ranges at which the channels of a tsig are defined
%    E=exist(T,[t0,t1]), where T is a multi-channel tsig, returns a struct
%    array E whose elements indicate the successive time intervals within
%    the total time range (t0,t1) at which the same subset of channels of 
%    T exist (different "episodes"). From E(k) to E(k+1), some channel 
%    kicks in or disappears. The fields of E are
%         tstart: start [ms] of this interval
%           tend: end [ms] of this interval
%          ichan: index array indicating the channels that exist during the
%                 interval (tstart,tend)
%         istart: sample index corresponding to tstart, counted from t0
%           iend: sample index corresponding to tend, counted from t0
%             i0: starting sample index, counted from start of channel
%             i1: last sample index, counted from start of channel
%           nsam: # samples is current episode
%
%    E=median(T) uses t0=min(T.onset)  and t1=max(T.offset) for the
%    evaluation interval.
%    
%    EXAMPLE.
%    Let T be sampled at 10 kHz and have 2 channels, the first of which 
%    runs from 5..20 ms; the second one from 10..50 ms. Then exist(T) 
%    returns a 3x1 struct array as displayed in the following table:
%
%              tstart   tend   istart iend  existing
%       E(1)     5       10       1    50     [1]
%       E(2)    10       20       1    50     [1 2]
%       E(3)    20       50       1    50     [2]
%
%    In tsig methods that analyze things across channels, tsig/exist
%    is used in cases that do not permit default values in non-existing
%    channels. The analysis then truly depends on the subset of channels
%    existing at a given instant of time, and tsig/exist provides the
%    bookkeeping for a blocked approach. An example is tsig/median.
%
%    See also tsig/median, tsig/plus, tsig/cat, tsig/isvoid.

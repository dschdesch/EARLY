% tsig/mean - MEAN for tsig objects.
%    M=mean(S) for tsig object S is a row vector M whose elements M(k) are 
%    the mean values of the respective channels of T, T(k).
%  
%    Mean(S,1) is the same as mean(S). Thus by convention, the "first 
%    dimension" of tsig objects is the time dimension. This is consistent 
%    with tsig/vertcat appending tsig objects in time.
%
%    T=mean(S,2) returns a tsig object containing the sample-wise mean
%    across channels. Thus by convention, the "second dimension" of tsig
%    objects is the channel number, which is consistent with tsig/horzcat
%    concatenating channels. Importantly, the channels are time-aligned
%    before being averaged. The mean tsig T runs from min([S.onset]) to 
%    max(S.offset), and for channels that do not cover this full range, 
%    zeros are padded in the missing parts.
% 
%    M=mean(S,2,'nozeros') is the same as mean(S,2) except that no zeros are
%    padded. In a given time range, the mean will be evaluated across only
%    those channels that cover this range. To illustrate the difference, 
%    suppose that the only channel in S that covers time interval (t0,t1) is
%    the first channel, S(1). In this time inteval, mean(S,2,'nozeros') 
%    equals S(1), while mean(S,2) equals S(1)/S.nchan.

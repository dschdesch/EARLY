% GUIaction - delegate work to action objects of GUI

%    uploaded to the GUI).
%
%    GUIaction(figh, @foo, @wrapup, DT) starts a timer that checks every
%    DT ms whether the foo-ing action objects have stopped or finished.
%    Once they all have, the timer tells them to wrapup, one by one.
%    Default DT=80 ms. 
%
%    GUIaction(figh, @foo, @wrapup, @clear, ..., DT) also invokes @clear, ...
%    on all listed Action objects, one by one. Note that all objects are
%    first visited by @wrapup before they are visted by @clear, etc.
%
%    GUIaction(figh, @foo, {@wrapup arg1 arg2 ..}, ...) uses @wrapup with
%    addition arguments, i.e., when the time is there, the call is
%    wrapup(A, arg1, arg2, ..)

function TM = TMmatrix(N,M,Di)
% TMmatrix - potential energy matrix of transmission line
%   TMmatrix(N,M,Di) returns NxN matrix describing an elastic interaction
%   between neighboring points on a closed transmission line. M is the 
%   order of the interaction, corresponding to the order of DIFF:
%      M=0 yields identity matrix ("elastic base")
%      M=1 sums the differences between adjacent points ("tension")
%      M=2 sums the diff of the diff of adjacent points ("bending stiffness")
%   Di is the distance between the coupled neighbors. Default Di = 1.
%
%   See also DIFF.

Di = arginDefaults('Di',1);
% there will no doubt be an elegant way of doing this, but let's be
% practical for one time.

function cleanup(D);
% Dataset/cleanup - remove temporary data on disk associated with dataset
%    cleanup(DS) checks whether any temporary data ("hoards") are
%    associated with DS. If so, these are deleted. Not intended for direct
%    use; called by dataset/save when the recording of DS was interrupted
%    and the user does not want to save the data.
%
%    The real work is delegated to datagrabber/cleanup.
%
%    See Dataset/save.

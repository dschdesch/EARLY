%    NpresRecorded(DS) returns the number of stimulus presentations for 
%    which dataset DS contains recordings. For a complete dataset, this 
%    number equals Npres, the total number of stimulus presentations 
%    (i.e., S.Stim.Presentation.Npres). For interrupted datasets, however,
%    recordings typically exist for a smaller number of presentations.

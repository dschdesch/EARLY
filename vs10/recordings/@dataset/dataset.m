% dataset - dataset constructor
%   DS = dataset(Experiment, Stim, Rec, Ax) initializes a dataset object.
%   Experiment is an experiment object specifying to which experiment DS 
%   belongs. Stim is the stimulus used to collect DS. Rec is a struct
%   containing recording instructions as returned by RecordingInstructions.
%   Datasets are dynamic objects. The address of DS ("upload destination") 
%   is specified by access struct Ax (see Dynamic). 
%
%   Filling DS with data is done by action ojects of class Supplier.
%
%   DS = dataset(Experiment, Stim, Rec, figh, 'Foo') is the same as
%   DS = dataset(Experiment, Stim, Rec, DataType, GUIaccess(figh,'Foo')).
%
%   Type 'methods dataset -full' to see what can be done with datasets. 
%
%   As of oktober 2016 a new field is added to the Stim struct: Stutter
%   If this field is set to 'On' the first condition is played twice, if it
%   is 'Off' the stimulus is played as usual. (By Adriaan Lambrechts)
%
%   See also Dynamic, Action, Supplier, GUIaccess, Experiment, 
%   RecordingInstructions.

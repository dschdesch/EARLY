function G = grab_comport(RecInstr, Hardware, DS, Ax, Name, You);
% grab_comport - grab data from serial port (COM port) of PC
%   G = grab_comport(RecInstr, RecHardware, DS, Ax, Name, You) creates a
%   grab_comport Action object G whose task it is to retrieve information
%   from a device connected to a COM port of the PC and to store it in
%   dataset DS. As long data collection hasn't finished, the data are kept 
%   in G and DS only has G's address. But DS also gets G's address, thus
%   enabling the final "transfer" of the data to DS (at wrapup time), which
%   is initiated by DS.
%   The input arguments are
%   RecInstr: detailed recording instructions as provided by
%             Experiment/recordInstructions. The following fields of
%             RecInstr are compulsory:
%          datafieldname: fieldname for storage in dataset DS
%                   Fsam: sample rate in kHz
%           grabInterval: interval in ms between consecutive calls to
%                         the recording device to upload samples. If
%                         grabInterval is an array [dt t0], then dt is the
%                         interval and t0 the waiting time preceding the
%                         first upload call.
%   RecHardware: generic info on hardware settings of the recording device.
%             See recHardware.
%         DS: dataset where data are stored, or its address. DS must have
%             an address, since this is what is stored in G, not DS itself.
%         Ax: address info to store G.
%   Grab_comport is a subclass of both the Action and Datagrabber classes.
%
%   grab_comport(RecInstr, Hardware, DS, FN, figh, 'Foo') is the same as
%   grab_comport(RecInstr, Hardware, DS, FN, GUIaccess(figh, 'Foo')).
%
%   G = grab_comport(RecInstr, Hardware, DS, FN, figh, 'Foo', 'You')
%   makes the finished status of G dependent on the finished status of the
%   action object names 'You' in the same figh GUI (see action/AfterYou).
%   Instead of a single You, a char string of names {'Me' 'You' 'Them'}
%   is also okay, in which case G is ready whenever all of the listed
%   Actions are.
%
%   grab_comport is tightly knot with the comport_data class, the data it is
%   supposed to produce.
%
%   Type 'methods grab_comport -full' to see what can be done with grab_comport
%   objects.

%   dataset/addsupplier, dataset/getdata, action/AfterYou.

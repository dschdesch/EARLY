% reportstimprogress - construct reportstimprogress object
%    R=reportstimprogress(SP, figh, DT, Ax) returns a reportstimprogress 
%    object R whose task it is to report the progress of ongoing stimulus
%    presentation. R is a action object. Inputs:
%       SP: stimpresent object containing the stimulus presentation
%     figh: handle to the GUI to which the report is sent (see GUImessage)
%       DT: update interval in ms.
%       Ax: upload destination of R (see Dynamic).
%
%    reportstimprogress(SP, figh, DT, figh, 'Foo') is the same as
%    reportstimprogress(SP, figh, DT, GUIaccess(figh, 'Foo')).
%
%    R=reportstimprogress(SP, figh, DT, figh, 'Foo', 'You') makes the being
%    finished of R (see action/isready) dependent on the being finished of
%    the Action object named 'You' in the same figh GUI (see action/AfterYou).
%    Instead of a single You, a char string of names {'Me' 'You' 'Them'}
%    are also okay.
%
%    Type 'methods reportstimprogress -full' to see what can be done with R.
%
%  See also sortConditions, GUImessage, action, dynamic.

function wrapup(A);
% action/wrapup - wrapup action of action object
%    A=wrapup(A) wraps up after the action of A is finished
%
%    This generic action/wrapup method only deletes the timer (if any) and 
%    changes A's status to 'wrappedup'. For many subclasses, wrapup will need 
%    overloading. This generic action/wrapup serves as a "catcher" that 
%    prevents a proliferation of timers. It may still be convenient to use
%    end the overloaded XXX/wrapup with the command wrapup(X.action), which
%    calls the generic action/wrapup.
%
%    See also playsound/wrapup, action/clear.

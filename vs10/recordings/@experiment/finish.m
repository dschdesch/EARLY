function finish(E, Cm);
% experiment/finish - finish Experiment and end its role as current one.
%    finish(E) sets the state of E to 'finished' and saves E. This is only
%    allowed if E is the current experiment. Note that this causes E to no
%    longer be the current experiment. The finishing is reported to E's
%    logfile.
%
%    finish(E, 'Foo') appends the text Foo to the logfile report.

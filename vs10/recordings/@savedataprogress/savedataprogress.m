%    S=savedataprogress(DS, DT, figh, 'XYZ', 'You') constructs an 
%    Action object S whose task it is to save a dataset for online data 
%    analysis by dataviewer during data collection. 
%    S is added to the list of Action of the figure
%    with handle figh under the name XYZ, and it will be finished as soon
%    as the Action object named You is finished. The dataset DS to be 
%    analyzed is assumed to have an address (in fact, it is okay to pass 
%    the address instead of the dataset). Every DT ms, an updated copy of 
%    DS is passed to a save function. 
%    At wrapup time, the data are once more updated and saved.
%
%    A special value for the Dataviewer is '-', in which case
%    savedataprogress calls Nope (=do nothing).

function TC=TimingCalibrate(G, flag);
% eventdata/TimingCalibrate - calibrate timing between analog output & input
%    TC=TimingCalibrate(G) performs a timing calibration of the Hardware and
%    returns the result in struct TC.
%
%    TimingCalibrate loads the appropriate SeqPlay-trig-2ADC circuit to
%    the D/A hardware (if needed) and calibrates the timing of its ADC 
%    recording re the analog output. The result is put in the TimingCalib
%    field of G in the form a a struct with fields:
%          Fsam: true sample frequency in Hz
%        Lag_ms: lag between D/A and A/D in ms
%    The circuit is only loaded when it hasn't been loaded already while
%    using the same sample rate.
%
%    TC=TimingCalibrate(G, 'force') always performs the calibration, even
%    if the same circuit is running at the same sample frequency since last
%    time.
%
%    The real work is delegated to DA_AD_TimingCalibrateRX6.
%
%    See also TimingCalibrateRX6, eventdata, grabevents, StimGUIAction,
%    SeqPlay.

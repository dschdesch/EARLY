function G = wrapup(G);
% grabevents/wrapup - wrap up Grabevents object after finishing or stopping
%    G = wrapup(G) wraps up event grabbing by Grabevents object G.
%    The following steps are taken:
%       1. final call to grabevents/oneshot to grab any pending events
%       2. store G's status @wrapup time in the G.Data.FinalStatus field.
%       3. delete the timer launched by grabevents/start
%       4. change G's status to 'wrappedup'
%    Steps 3 & 4 are delegated to action/wrapup.
%
%    Note that no tranfer the data to G's receiving dataset is done here.
%    Data transfer is iniated by Dataset/getdata, which in turn calls upon 
%    @grabevents/getdata to copy the data.

% showdataprogress/wrapup - one final update of the online data analysis
%    wrapup(S) updates the online analysis once after data collection is
%    complete. This is done by calling oneshot(S, 'force'). After that, a
%    call to action/wrapup makes sure that the timer of S is stopped and
%    its status is set to wrappedup.

function [S, DPfreq] = DPfreqs(F, Nmax, WeightSum)
% DPfreqs - low-order distortion products from a set of primary frequencies
%   S = DPfreqs(Freq, Nmax) evaluates distortion products arising by the
%   nonlinear interaction of pure tones at frequencies Freq(k). Nmax is the
%   maximum order of the DPs considered. The return argument S is a struct
%   with fields
%          freq: frequency of the DP in the same units as the input Freq
%         order: order of the SP, which equals sum(abs(weight)).
%        weight: integer weighting factors such that freq = dot(weight,freq)
%     sumweight: sum of weights
%   combifactor: combinatorial factor indicating the algebraic multiplicity 
%                of term coresponding to this DP frequency.
%        dbdown: the amplitude factor in dB corresponding to combifactor.
%          mult: multiplicity, i.e. how many times does freq occur in the
%                complete collection of DPs upto order Nmax.
%   Only non-negative DP frequencies are considered.
%
%   DPfreqs(Freq, Nmax, S) restricts the DPs to those whose summed weights
%   equal S. The default is S=[] meaning that no restriction is imposed.
%
%   Note that weights can also be used to compute the DP phase from the
%   phases of the primaries.
%
%   [S, DPfreq]  = DPfreqs(Freq, Nmax) also returns all the DP frequencies
%   in array DPfreq. That is, DPfreq = [S.freq].
%
%   See also DPmatrix, partitions.

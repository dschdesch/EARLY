% APtruncate - truncate action potentials from recorded trace - slope version
%   [Vrec, tAP, Tsn, Snip, APslope] =  APtruncate2(Vrec, ThrSlope, dt, Twin, makeNan) 
%   surgically removes the action potentials from recorded trace Vrec as follows:
%     - downward slopes steeper than ThrSlope mV/ms are considered APs; if
%       ThrSlope has two elements, ThrSlope(1) is the threshold for being
%       an AP and ThrSlope(2) is the threshold for being "surgically removed"
%       (see below) without actually counting as an AP.
%     - for each AP, the time of the maximum, Tmax, is determined
%     - the portion of the trace from Tmax+Twin(1) to Tmax+Twin(2) is
%       replaced by the linear interpolation between its endpoints or, if ,
%       makeNan is true, by nans.
%     - if multiple APs overlap, i.e., Tmax1+Twin(2)>Tmax2+Twin(1),
%       their union is surgically removed (instead of removing the
%       constituent APs one by one).
%
%    Inputs
%      Vrec: recording, If matrix, each column is truncated.
%    ThrSlope: AP threshold for dVrec/dt (same units as Vrec/dt)
%            if ThrSlope has two elements, ThrSlope(1) is the 
%            threshold for being an AP and ThrSlope(2) is the 
%            threshold for being "surgically removed". Anaything in
%            between is removed (just to make sure) but not accepted as AP.
%        dt: sample period of recording
%      Twin: 2-element vector [-Tbefore, Tafter] as explained before. Same
%            units as dt.
%   makeNan: logical. If true, the APs are replaced by NaNs. If false (the
%            default), they are replaced by linear extrapolation of the
%            endpoints.
%
%    Outputs
%      Vrec: truncated recording trace
%       tAP: AP peak times in same units as dt.
%       Tsn: time [ms] array corresponding to Snip (runs from Twin(1) to Twin(2))
%      Snip: snippet matrix. Columns are AP the waveforms.
%    APslope: array holding min slope in V/S of the respective APs.

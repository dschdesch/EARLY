function Vrec = APtruncate(Vrec, Vthr, dt, Twin);
% APtruncate - truncate action potentials from recorded trace
%   Vrec =  APtruncate(Vrec, Vthr, dt, Twin) surgically removes the
%   action potentials from recorded trace Vrec as follows:
%     - all local maxima exceeding Vthr are considered APs
%     - for each AP, the time of the maximum, Tmax, is determined
%     - the portion of the trace from Tmax-Twin(1) to Tmax+Twin(2) is
%       replaced by the linear interpolation between its endpoints.
%
%    Inputs:
%      Vrec: recording, If matrix, each column is truncated.
%      Vthr: threshold for AP (same units as Vrec)
%        dt: sample period of recording
%      Twin: 2-element vector [-Tbefore, Tafter] as explained before. Same
%            units as dt.

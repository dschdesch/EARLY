function [R, alpha] = vectorstrength(spt, freq, TW);
% VectorStrength - vector strength of spike train
%   VectorStrength(Spt, Freq), where Spt is an array of spike arrival
%   times [ms], and Freq is a frequency [Hz], returns the vector strength
%   at frequency Freq of the spike times in Spt. 
%
%   VectorStrength(spt, freq, [t0 t1]) only uses spike times between t0 and
%   t1 ms. The phases are weighted inversely proportional to the number of 
%   times they were visited by the wrapping frequency. 
%
%   [R, alpha] = VectorStrength(spt, freq) returns complex R and 
%   confidence level according to Rayleigh statistics
%
%   If Spt is a cell array, R and alpha will be column arrays, with
%    [R(k) alpha(k)] = VectorStrength(spt{k});
%
%   If Spt is a cell array and Freq is an array having the same lenght,
%   then Freq(k) is used to compute the VectorStrength from Spt{k}.
%
%   If Spt is a N x M cell array and Freq is a length-N vector, then the
%   cells Spt(k,:) are pooled ("pooling across repetitions") before the
%   calculation of vector strength(s).

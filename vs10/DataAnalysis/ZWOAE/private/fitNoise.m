% Pnoise = fitNoise(MG, Nloops, df), where;
% MG is spectrum, Nloops = Nsam/periodicity, and df = freq. spacing [kHz]
% Function fits a polynomial to the noise floor & returns the
% coefficients of this fit in Pnoise. 
%
% Nsam          : # of samples in recorded signal
% periodicity   : # of samples over which recording is periodic

% Nloops determines which freq-bins in the spectrum are noise. The noise
% floor is fitted with a polynomial (order specified in function) and from
% that all noise data points < fitted function are removed. Remaining data
% are again fitted with polynomial,...
% In total, this is repeated 4 times before returning coefficients.

% Syntax example:
%
% D.Pnf = fitNoise(MG, Nsam/D.periodicity);

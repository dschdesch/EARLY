function [D, fac, CMgain] = correctCMamplitude(D);
%correctCMamplitude -correct amplitude in case of CM recordings
%
%D = correctCMamplitude(D) "converts" the amplitude data in struct D (from ZWOAEimport)
% from "dB SPL" to dB re. 1V. This is for CM recordings. The CM
% amplification factor is also taken into account.
%
% [D, fac] = correctCMamplitude(D) also returns the factor fac (in dB) that
% has to be added to the amplitude data to go from dB SPL to dBV.
% This factor includes both dB SPL --> dBV and amplification
%
% [D, fac, ampl] = correctCMamplitude(D) also returns the conversion factor
% ampl (which is already included in fac!). This is the correction for only the amplification (in dB)
%
% NOTE: this function is already invoked within ZWOAEimport so that CM
% recordings are "corrected" when returned by ZWOAEimport.

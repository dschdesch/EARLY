% ZWOAEbackTime - estimate backward (CM-to-OAE) travel time of DPs
%    ZWOAEbackTime(igerbil, irec, DPtype) estimates from a AC/CM pair of
%    recordings the CM-to-ear canal travel time [us] of the DPs of given type.
%    Input Args:
%      igerbil: gerbil index (see ZWOAEimport)
%         irec: recording index of either the AC(oustical) or the CM
%               measurement. The other one is found by ZWOAEcompanions.
%       DPtype: type of distortion product: 'near', 'far', etc. For a full
%               listing of DP types, see ZWOAEsubspec.
%    ZWOAEbackTime returns the estimated backward travel time in us. If irec
%    is an array, an array of travel time estimates is returned.
%    The result of the analysis is returned in a struct with fields:
%      igerbil,etc: all input args
%          tauBack: CM to acoustic delay [us]
%              Ph0: CM to acoustic phase offset [cycle]
%           DPfreq: DP frequencies [kHz]
%             Dphi: CM to acoustic phase differences per DPfreq [cycle]
%              Dev: deviations of fitted and measured Dphi [cycle] 
%           RMSdev: RMS of Dev.
%       meanDPfreq: mean DP frequency [kHz]
%                W: weight factors of Dphi evaluated from SNR ratios.
%
%    ZWOAEbackTime(igerbil, irec, DPtype, tauCM2AC) compensates for the
%    last part of the travel, i.e., from the base of the cochlea to the
%    microphone. If tauCM2AC is a single number, tauCM2AC [us] is simply
%    subtracted from the estimated backward time. If tauCM2AC has multiple
%    components, it is interpreted as a polynomial describing the
%    compensatory delay [us] as a function of DP frequency [kHz].
%
%    ZWOAEbackTime(igerbil, irec, DPtype, Freq, DphAC2CM) also compensates
%    for the last part of the backward travel, but this time by processing
%    linear phase data. Freq is an array of frequencies [kHz] and DphAC2CM
%    holds the corresponding AC-to-CM phase data [cycles], i.e. Phcm-Phac.
%
%    [tauBack, Dev, DPfreq]=ZWOAEbackTime(..) also returns Dev=RMS(D), 
%    where D are the differences between the phase and the linear fit used 
%    to estimate the group delay, and Freq, the mean frequency [kHz] of the
%    DPs under consideration.

%    See also LinPhaseFit, ZWOAEsubspec, ZWOAEimport.

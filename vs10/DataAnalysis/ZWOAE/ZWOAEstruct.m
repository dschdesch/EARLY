% .numaverage     : number of blocks that were averaged
% .micsensitivity : struct with fields that speccify the microphone
%                   sensitivity. Fields are:
%                   .dBSPL:      : A tone of "dBSPL" dB SPL gives a mic. output of "dBV" dBV
%                   .dBV         : output of microphone for a tone of "dBSPL" dB SPL
%
% .signal         : averaged signal, first periodic block is omitted to
%                   exclude onset phenomena
% .micgain        : gain setting for microphone signal
% .units          : structure with units for different saved parameters.
%                 Fields are:

%
% .stimpars       : structure with "command line" parameters. Here, the
%                  amplitude of several freq. components may be very low (i.e. not played)
%                  Within .stimpars are the following fields:
%                    .N1          : array with on/off bit mask for all
%                                   F1's (1 is on, 0 is off)
%                    .N2          : array with on/off bit mask for all
%                                   F2's (1 is on, 0 is off)
%                    .F1          : array with all F1-frequencies
%                    .F2          : array with all F2-frequencies
%                    .L1          : array with all L1-levels (as parameter)
%                    .L2          : array with all L2-levels (as parameter)
%                    .phi1        : array with all starting phases for F1's
%                    .phi2        : array with all starting phases for F2's
%
% .setupinfo      : structure holding info about the recording setup,
%                   experimenter, and the animal. Fields are:

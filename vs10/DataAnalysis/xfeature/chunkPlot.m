function C = chunkPlot(C, T, S, varargin);
% ChunkPlot - plot or highlight chunks
%    ChunkPlot(C, T, S, ...) xplots chunks in a S-versus-T plot. 
%    S is the Signal from which the chunks are cut using struct array C 
%    (see Xchunks, Getchunk). T is typically the time axis of recorded 
%    signal S. If T is a single number or a 2-element vector, a time axis
%    TimeAxis(S,T) is used. Alternatively T and S may both be signals, 
%    e.g., a recording and its time derivative. When S and/or T are 
%    matrices, the chunk extraction is done along the first dimension.
%
%    Note that cutting the chunks from S (and, possibly, T) is based on the
%    sample index fields of C, C.istart and C.iend. Any time information 
%    contained in C is ignored. 
%
%    Trailing args indicated by ellipses (...) are passed to xplot.
%
%    See also xplot, Xchunks, GetChunk, EvalChunks.

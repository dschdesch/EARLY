function DX = derivative(X, M);
% Derivative - estimated time-derivative of sampled signal
%   D=Derivative(X, M) estimates the time derivative D of array X, whereby
%   X is considered as a sampled time signal. M is the length of each the
%   tails used for convolution. Default M = 10. D has one sample less than
%   X.

% xchunks - basic chunk extraction from recording trace
%   CH = xchunks(D, Nsmooth, M) extracts "chunk" array CH from data in array X. 
%   A chunk is a segment of the recording that is monotonically rising or 
%   falling. Not all of such monotonic segments end up as chunks; in order
%   to become a chunk, a segment must meet one of the following criteria:
%
%     1. its "span" (absolute value between start and end value) exceeds M
%        times the IQR of the recording;
%     2. The span of both "neighbors" (segments adjacent to it) exceeds M
%        times the IQR.
%     3. the segment is one of a pair of neighbors, both of which are "small"
%        (fail to meet criterium #1), but whos summed span exceed M*IQR.
%
%   Input args:
%          X: array of samples (typically a recording).
%    Nsmooth: length of smooting hamming window. 
%          M: IQR factor as described above. Default M=5. If M is a
%             2-component array, M(1) and M(2) are used as factors for
%             testing criterium 1&2 and 3, respectively.
%    Output arg:
%        CH: struct array of chunks.
%  
%    Xchunk performs the generic feature extraction that provides a basis 
%    of more specific feature extraction in terms of physiological
%    interpretation.
%
%    [CH, h] = Xchunks(X, Nsmooth, M, dt) also plots the waveform X using 
%    a sample period of dt ms. The chunks are highlited in red. The
%    graphics handle h of the newly opened figure is returned. The plotting
%    is delegated to BasicChunkPlot.

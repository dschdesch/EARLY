% anarayleigh - rayleigh test for phase locking of analog waveform
%   Alpha = anarayleigh(X, dt, Freq, RampDur, Nchunk)
%   returns confidence level Alpha for the Fourier component at frequency
%   Freq Hz of the analog time signal X sampled at dt ms. To determine
%   Alpha, X is divided in Nchunk nonoverlapping chunks by setting all the
%   samples of X outside the chunk to zero, and the Fourier
%   components at Freq Hz are computed for each of these chunks. Their
%   phase values are then subjcted to a Rayleigh test. Fourier transforms
%   are computed after windowing the time signals using a cos^2 window
%   of duration RampDur ms. For arrays Freq, Alpha is an array of the same
%   size.

% BasicChunkPlot - plot samples and highlight chunks
%    BasicChunkPlot(C, dt, S, Ynoise) plots the samples in S against time (ms).
%    The time axis starts at zero and has a spacing of dt ms. Horizontal
%    dashed lines, ranging form time 0 to the end, are plotted at vertical
%    positions Ynoise(k). The chunks are highlighted in red. Additional
%    plot args will be passed to the call to xplot that renders the chunks.
%    
%    BasicChunkPlot opens a new figure and returns its graphics handle.
%
%    ChunkPlot(C, [dt t0], S, Ynoise) uses a starting time t0 instead of
%    zero (see timeAxis).
%
%    Note that cutting the chunks from S (and, possibly, T) is based on the
%    sample index fields of C, C.istart and C.iend. Any time information
%    contained in C is ignored.

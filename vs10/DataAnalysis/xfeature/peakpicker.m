%             X: recording trace. Matrices are treated as sets of rows.
%           Thr: threshold. Peaks must exceed Thr
%         R50Hz: whether to reject 50 Hz [false]
%        minISI: minimum interval (ms) between peaks (default 0.5 ms). Any
%                peak preceded or followed, within minISI ms, by a larger 
%                peak is eliminated from the output.
%   Output T is cell array. T{k} holds peak times of trace X(:,k)
%   in ms from start of X.
%

%   peak values P themselves and the 50-Hz filtered version Xf of X. P has
%   the same format as T, that is, P{k} contains the peak values extracted
%   from X(:,k). If no 50-Hz filtering was applied, Xf is identical to X.

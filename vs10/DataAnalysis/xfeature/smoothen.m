% smoothen - smooth data by convolution with a hamming window
%   smoothen(X, N) smooths array X by convolving X with a N-th order,
%   normalized, hamming window. N is rounded upward to the next odd mumber.
%   The result is truncated symmetrically so that it has the same length 
%   as X. If X is a matrix, its columns are smoothed. 
%
%   smoothen(X, -N) assumes that X is periodic and uses a N-long window.
%   In this case, smoothing connects the first part of X with the last.
%
%   smoothen(X, Width, dt) uses a N = round(Width/dt) as the length of the
%   window, that is, the window width is specified in the X-axis units of
%   the input array X.
%
%   smoothen(X, Width, -dt) subtracts the averages the columns of X prior 
%   to the convolution and adds the column averages afterwrds. This reduces
%   edge effects.
%
%   [X, M]=smoothen(...) also returns the length M of the hanning window
%   used for smoothing.

% locateSegment - locate segment within array
%    I = locateSegment(Seg, X) finds the position I in X for which array
%    Seg and X(I+(1:N)) are optimally close in a Euclidian sense, where
%    N is length(Seg). If X is a matrix, I is a row vector containing the
%    locations if Seg with each of the columns of X.
%
%    [I, D] = locateSegment(Seg, X) also returns the euclidean distance D
%    between the Seg and the nearest segment within X.

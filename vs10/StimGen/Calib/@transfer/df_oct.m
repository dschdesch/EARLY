% transfer/df_oct - frequency spacing of complex transfer function 
%    df_oct(T) returns the frequency spacing of T in octaves.

%    Note: It is assumed that the frequencies have logarithmic spacing, 
%    which is true when they have been created using transfer/measure and
%    transfer/patch.

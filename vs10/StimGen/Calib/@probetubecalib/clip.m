% Probetubecalib/Clip - clip part of Tube response between specified limits
%   PTC = Clip(PTC, [f1 f2], Mn Mx) clips the magnitude of a restricted 
%   frequency range of the Tube trf of PTC. The values are limited 
%   between minimum value Mn dB and max value mx dB.
%   The frequency range is indicated by the frequencies f1 and f2 (Hz).
%   The change induced by clip is added to the EditHistory of PTC, unless
%   the action was void, e.g. an empty frquency range.
